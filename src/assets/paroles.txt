All my friends can see my Pain 
Want to bury me in flames
All my life is lead by Shame
I would fall on the walk of fame

Thiiii

I m always thinking ov
My penis is looking for Love
The only who can judge me is above
I would rape my cheersloves

Tihiiiii

I m always thinking ov
My penis is looking for Love
The only who can judge me is above
I would rape my cheersloves

I would put my dick in your face
While your sleep because you re sick
U'll think that's god who bless
That is the start of your race

Thiiii

I m always thinking ov
My penis is looking for Love
The only who can judge me is above
I would rape my cheersloves

The beginning of our Relation
While you re in suffocation
Sucking without Reason
This is my last Penetration

Thiii
I m always thinking ov
My penis is looking for Love
The only who can judge me is above
I would rape my cheersloves

I would rape
think ov
my cheerslove
Up above
